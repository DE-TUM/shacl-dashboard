GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 19 November 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

 The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
 software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure
 cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.

 The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
 to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
 our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to
 share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
 software for all its users.

 When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
 price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
 have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
 them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
 want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
 free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

 Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights
 with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer
 you this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute
 and/or modify the software.

 A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that
 improvements made in alternate versions of the program, if they
 receive widespread use, become available for other developers to
 incorporate.  Many developers of free software are heartened and
 encouraged by the resulting cooperation.  However, in the case of
 software used on network servers, this result may fail to come about.
 The GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and
 letting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its
 source code to the public.

 The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to
 ensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available
 to the community.  It requires the operator of a network server to
 provide the source code of the modified version running there to the
 users of that server.  Therefore, public use of a modified version, on
 a publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source
 code of the modified version.

 An older license, called the Affero General Public License and
 published by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals.  This is
 a different license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has
 released a new version of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under
 this license.

 The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
 modification follow.

                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS

 0. Definitions.

 "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.

 "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
 works, such as semiconductor masks.

 "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
 License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
 "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

 To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
 in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
 exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
 earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

 A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
 on the Program.

 To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
 permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
 infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
 computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
 distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
 public, and in some countries other activities as well.

 To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
 parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
 a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

 An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
 to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
 feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
 tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
 extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
 work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
 the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
 menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

 1. Source Code.

 The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
 for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
 form of a work.

 A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
 standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
 interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
 is widely used among developers working in that language.

 The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
 than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
 packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
 Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
 Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
 implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
 "Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
 (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
 (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
 produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

 The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
 the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
 work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
 control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
 System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
 programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
 which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
 includes interface definition files associated with source files for
 the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
 linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
 such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
 subprograms and other parts of the work.

 The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
 can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
 Source.

 The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
 same work.

 2. Basic Permissions.

 All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
 copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided that the
 stated conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your
 unlimited, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free
 permission to run, study, share and modify the Program.

 3. Copyleft.

 This License requires that modified versions of the Program be
 marked in reasonable ways as different from the unmodified Program,
 and that the whole of the unmodified and modified Program be
 distributed under the terms of this License, whose main conditions
 are inescapable: share alike and no warranty.

 4. Source Code Distribution.

 Complete source code for the modified version must be made
 available to all recipients of the unmodified Program, in the same
 way and at the same time as the modified version is conveyed.
 This includes whatever it takes to make the modified version
 work, including but not limited to the Corresponding Source, any
 installation scripts, and any required data files.

 5. Object Code Distribution.

 Object code versions of the Program may be distributed
 outside the scope of this License, provided that the object code
 is not accompanied by any source code.  However, this License
 requires that the source code be made available in the manner
 specified in section 4 as soon as is practicable, and that no
 further restrictions are imposed on the recipients of the object
 code.

 6. Combined Works.

 You may convey a combined work that includes the Program, or
 distribute the Program as part of a larger work, provided that
 you do not impose any further restrictions on the Program than
 are imposed by this License, and provided that the source code
 for the Program is available under the terms of this License
 alongside the larger work.

 7. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

 You may convey a work's modified source code as part of the
 Program, provided that the entire work is licensed under this
 License, and provided that you include in the modified source
 code a prominent statement that the original code was changed
 and the date of the change.

 8. Aggregation with Independent Works.

 You may convey a work licensed under this License as part of
 an aggregate work, provided that the License also covers the
 aggregate work.

 9. Automatic Licensing Updates.

 Licensees who convey a modified version of the Program give
 recipients all the rights of the original License, and also
 provide a copy of this License, so that everyone else also
 receives the rights and conditions of this License.

 10. Disclaimer of Warranty.

 There is no warranty for the Program, and the copyright
 holders are not liable for any damages related to the Program
 or its use.  There is no warranty that the Program will be
 useful to you, or that it will work with any software or
 hardware.

 11. Limitation of Liability.

 The liability of the copyright holders is limited to the
 amount of money you paid for the Program, if any.  In no
 event shall the copyright holders be liable for any indirect,
 incidental, special, exemplary, or consequential damages
 arising out of the use or inability to use the Program.

 12. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability.

 While redistributing the Program or Derivative Works thereof,
 You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of
 support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations
 and/or rights consistent with this License.  However, in
 accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own
 behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any
 other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend,
 and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred
 by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
 of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
